A day planner using moment.js and JQuery!

## Description

This is a day planner app that I created using moment.js and JQuery. When the user opens the planner, then a current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm). Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks a time block, then they can enter an event. When the user presses the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed, then the saved events persist.

## Visuals/Screenshots
